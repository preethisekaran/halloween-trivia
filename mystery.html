                        <p><strong>The Motive:</strong> She overheard Lord Blackwood's plan to change his will and leave everything to charity, which would mean losing her job and home at the manor.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>The Deception:</strong> She planted Dr. Marsh's empty medical vial in the study to frame the doctor, knowing about the digitalis prescription.</p>
